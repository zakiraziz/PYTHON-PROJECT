Tic Tac Toe Game in Python 🕹️
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe – a fun and interactive game built using Python!

📝 Project Description
This is a command-line Tic Tac Toe game where two players (X and O) can take turns to play. The program checks for wins and announces the winner. It’s a great exercise for learning about lists, condition checking, and function handling in Python.

🛠️ Features
Turn-based Gameplay: X and O take turns to place their marks.
Automatic Win Detection: The game checks for winning combinations after every move.
Simple UI: Played directly in the console.
Fully Functional Game: Includes draw conditions and displays the board after each move.
📂 Project Structure
sum(a, b, c): Function that adds three values.
printBoard(xState, zState): Displays the current state of the board.
